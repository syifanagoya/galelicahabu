Will this have an impact on Vince McMahon’s net worth?</strong></p><p>Well, who would not know that one of the most successful businessmen from the United States of America, Vince McMahon has worked extremely hard to get to where he is now, and his efforts for WWE have netted him billions of dollars.</p><p>He marketed WWE across the world and established himself as a well-known celebrity as the chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of WWE, as well as the founder of Alpha Entertainment.</p><p>In this article, you will get to know how much Vince McMahon’s net worth is expected to be in 2022 and how his life as the wealthiest man is progressing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Vince McMahon’s Life and Career</h2><p>Born on August 24, 1945 in Pinehurst, North Carolina, USA, Vince Kennedy McMahon’s father, Vincent James McMahon abandoned his family.</p><p>He met his father for the first time when he turned 12 years old. He was inclined to follow in his father’s footsteps in pro wrestling and would frequently accompany him to Madison Square Garden after they met.&nbsp;</p><p>McMahon aspired to be a professional wrestler, though his father stopped him. He was raised by his mother, Victoria, who helped him cope with his learning disability and dyslexia.</p><p>He managed to finish his graduation in 1964 from Fishburne Military School then in 1968, he went to East Carolina University and earned a bachelor’s degree in Business.</p><p>McMahon clearly had a real passion for this profession, as seen by his enormous charm and intensity.</p><p>His father had taken a major step about Vince’s professional life after his graduation. He was indeed the CEO and founder of the WWF (World Wrestling Federation) at that time.&nbsp;</p><p>Vince was finally able to make his long-awaited debut as a commentator. In 1969, he undoubtedly began his career as a ringside commentator.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1970s, Vince McMahon rose to the top of his dad’s business empire. In under a decade, he and his father increased their television viewership and became the popular face of the entertainment industry.&nbsp;</p><p>After his father’s sudden death in 1982, Vince McMahon gained sole control of the company and rebranded the company’s name as WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Vince McMahon’s Net Worth</h2><p>When it comes to Vincent Kennedy McMahon’s net worth, he has received a large portion of his <a href=#>wealth</a> as reward for his job as the chairman of the WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) over the years.</p><p>Being in a prominent position, he not only invested in his father’s company but also in many business ventures such as real estate holdings, professional sports teams and TV channels.</p><p>Vince McMahon has a net worth of $2.4 billion USD as of June 2022. He possesses class B shares, which give him 80 percent of WWE’s voting power and around a third of the company’s annual outstanding stock.</p><p>However a series of shareholdings have enhanced McMahon’s fortune, much of the cash gained by the family of McMahon has been plowed back into the business for a long time.</p><p>McMahon formed the World Bodybuilding Federation in 1990, but it disbanded in 1992.</p><p>McMahon also contributed to the creation of the WWE Network, which is the most-watched streaming service, in February 2014.</p><p>In 2017, McMahon sold 3.34 million shares for a combined amount of $100 million, which he promptly invested in the XFL venture.</p><p>He also made a huge 272 million dollar profit in April 2019 when he sold 3.2 million shares of his company, WWE’s stock that had recovered tremendously.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Will Stepping down as Chairman Affect His Net Worth?</h2><p>The fact that he stepped down from his responsibilities as his daughter, Stephanie McMahon, has taken the control of the company amidst of the scandal, the company has released a statement in which it stated,</p><p><strong>“Mr. McMahon will remain involved with W.W.E. ‘s creative content and remains committed to cooperating with the review underway.”</strong></p><p>The board of directors of the company will look into allegations of sexual misconduct against Vince McMahon in detail. However, McMahon appeared on Friday Night SmackDown, he made a brief appearance to a round of cheers, when he entered the ring.</p><p>He stormed out of the ring, dropping his mic and invoking the WWE’s “<strong>Then, Now, Forever, Together</strong>“ slogan.</p><p>Meanwhile, McMahon said in a statement, <strong>“I have pledged my complete cooperation to the Special Committee’s investigation, and I will do everything possible to support the investigation.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>“I have also pledged to accept the investigation’s findings and outcome, whatever they are,” </strong>he added<strong>.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Is the Case About?</h2><p>According to The Wall Street Journal, Vince McMahon agreed to cover a secret $3 million settlement to an employee with whom he was claimed to have had an affair.</p><p>He also had agreed to pay a private settlement to a former employee with whom McMahon had allegedly had a relationship that was consensual.</p><p>So when their affair became sexual, McMahon allegedly boosted her paralegal income from $100,000 to $200,000 and “toyed” with WWE executive John Laurinaitis:</p><p>According to persons involved with the board investigation, the first email to the board stated, “My friend was so scared as she quit after Vince McMahon and lawyer Jerry paid her millions of dollars to shut up.”</p><p>And as per evidence, Vince McMahon’s personal lawyer, Mr. [Jerry] McDevitt, negotiated the money settlement.</p><p>McMahon’s lawyer told The Journal that as of now the former employee had not filed any charges of harassment against him, and that the settlement was paid with personal money.</p><p>Since April, the board had already been looking into the matter. Other nondisclosure agreements relating allegations of Mr. McMahon’s sexual misconduct were found during the investigation, as per The Journal.</p><p>The investigation was carried out by independent legal counsel appointed by the company. That would also collaborate with an outside business to assess the company’s compliance, human resources department, and overall culture.</p><p>However, it’s unclear whether McMahon will be required to sell his shares in the company he established, and that won’t be determined until the investigation is completed.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDCyKeanmWdmLqitM6nZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./atlanta-oldest-bars-and-restaurants.html>&#171;&nbsp;7 of Atlanta's oldest bars and restaurants</a>
