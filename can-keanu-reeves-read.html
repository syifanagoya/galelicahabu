Due to this, many people don’t know about his struggles growing up, particularly with reading.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Keanu Reeves had trouble reading growing up as he is dyslexic, he can now read as an adult. Though Keanu is a published author and reads scripts for movies, he is dyslexic.

It causes problems with identifying which letters make which sound.&nbsp;</p><p>Dyslexia is commonly undiagnosed, it is estimated that 40 million people in the United States are dyslexic, but only 2 million people know it.&nbsp;</p><p>Keanu Reeves is likely part of the group of people who had undiagnosed dyslexia growing up as he was kicked out of most of his high schools.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>He says</a>, “Because I had trouble reading, I wasn’t a good student. I didn’t finish high school. I did a lot of pretending as a child. It was my way of coping with the fact that I didn’t really feel like I fit in.”&nbsp;</p><p>It seems as though Keanu knew that he had trouble reading, but his teachers may have not known and instead of helping him, they expelled him.&nbsp;</p><p>He attended four different high schools in Toronto where he grew up. He attended two art schools, <a href=# rel=noopener>Etobicoke School of the Arts</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>De La Salle College</a>, and was expelled from them for being “rambunctious”.</p><p>He went on to attend <a href=# rel=noopener>Avondale Secondary Alternative School</a> as he could pursue his acting career there at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>Reeves ended up dropping out of that high school at 17 years old to instead pursue his acting career in Los Angeles, California.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems like if Reeves did not have trouble in school due to his dyslexia, he may not be on the same path that he is today.</p><p>Though he is still dyslexic since it is a lifelong disorder, Keanu can now read and write. He says even though he had trouble reading growing up, <a href=# rel=noopener>he loves Shakespeare</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>He further says: “I recite Shakespeare to calm myself down. When I was 18, I did Romeo and Juliet on stage. It’s very relaxing when you read it out loud.”&nbsp;</p><p>His love of Shakespeare likely inspired him to write poetry of his own as he is actually a published author.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Secret Poet and Author</h2><p>Keanu Reeves is a published author of two books. The first is called <a href=# rel=noopener>Ode to Happiness</a> that was published in 2011. He describes it as a “grown up’s picture book”.&nbsp;</p><p>The book consists of a poem written by Reeves and each page is illustrated by artist Alexandra Grant. It started as just a poem given to the book’s editor Janey Bergam,</p><p>She, however, made it into a book and gave it to Reeves. He loved it so much that he wanted it to be published.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>He says about it</a>: “There is a kind of life experience in it. I was hoping people would find it relatable and hopefully transformative in a sense.”&nbsp;</p><p>He went on to publish another, similar style of book called <a href=# rel=noopener>Shadows</a> which was published in 2016. This book is another poetry book but features pictures of Keanu’s shadows instead of illustrated images.&nbsp;</p><p>It is meant to, “Explore the real and symbolic nature of the shadow as an image and figure of speech.”&nbsp;</p><p>So, Keanu Reeves may have struggled with reading and writing when he was younger, he is now an accomplished author and actor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jpyYp2Wbmq6vwYyrnJ6ulah6s7HAnWY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./taylor-swift-at-the-2024-golden-globes-lip-reading-theories-more.html>&#171;&nbsp;Taylor Swift at the 2024 Golden Globes: Lip-Reading Theories, More</a>
